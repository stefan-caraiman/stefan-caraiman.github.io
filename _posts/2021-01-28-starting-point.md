# Who am I


```console
~/ whoami

Hey there, my name is Dana! 👩🏻‍💻
```

I’m not going to bore you right now and we will get straight to the point!

I suppose you want to know / understand / learn things that DevOps guys and girls do; from my experience so far I can tell you that every company understands DevOps differently – some will say that DevOps is automation, some will say it’s development and others will say it’s sys-admining … boy if I would ask my grandma she would think it is something or someone that cleans chimneys.


# Where to start: 

## Operating systems 💻

I don’t care who you are or what you do, you must understand how operating systems work (Linux, Windows even MacOs). Everything that you do, sits on an operating system. 

The golden rule, atleast in Linux, is that everything is a file! Start exploring from there.

## Networking 🚠

Once you got to event understand why operating systems exist, you must understand what a network does. Or how a grandma might describe it:  a bird nest = network, the bird = your computer that has an operating system, therefore your computer with an operating system sits in a network. 

## Scripting and programming 👾

Your operating system doesn’t understand “go fetch me some infos”, it’s not a dog, you need to communicate with him using commands like “echo” , “sudo apt” or “whoami” – I ask myself every day. 

## Cloud or virtual machines ☁️

From here things get funky. What you should know is that these are your bread and butter.

They are not something magical in the clouds, these are just simple servers(or baremetals) that someone else(preferably) hosts for you.

Stay close, I will teach you how to look for things and how to not die when things get nasty.
