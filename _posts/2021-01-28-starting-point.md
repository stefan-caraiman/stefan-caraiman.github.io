Hey there, my name is Dana! 

I’m not going to bore you right now, and we will get straight to the point! I suppose you want to know / understand / learn things that DevOps guys and girls do; from my experience so far, I can tell you that every company understands DevOps differently – some will say that devops is automation, some will say it’s development and others will say it’s sys-admining … boy if I would ask my grandma she would think it is something or someone that cleans chimneys.


# Where to start: 

## Operating systems

I don’t care who you are or what you do, you must understand how operating systems work (Linux, Windows even MacOs). Everything that you do, sits on an operating system. 

## Networking

Once you got to event understand why operating systems exist, you must understand what a network does. Or how a grandma might describe it:  a bird nest = network, the bird = your computer that has an operating system, therefore your computer with an operating system sits in a network. 

## Scripting and programming 

Your operating system doesn’t understand “go fetch me some infos”, it’s not a dog, you need to communicate with him using commands like “echo” , “sudo apt” or “whoami” – I ask myself every day. 

## Cloud or virtual machines 

From here things get funky. 


Stay close, I will teach you how to look for things and how to not die when things get nasty.
