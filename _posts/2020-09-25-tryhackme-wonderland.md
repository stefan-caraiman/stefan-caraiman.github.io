This post serves as a walkthrough for the **Wonderland** room challenge on the **TryHackMe** platform.

I've had quite a lot of fun with this one and learned quite a lot of new tools, so for anyone interested into **hacking** and the process behind it, feel free to try the [room][room] as well by yourself. üçÄ

**Note ‚ùó:** Beware that this blogpost is trying to be as **beginner level** friendly as possible, as I will try to also explain some of the tools and logic that goes into trying to break into a machine. 


## Information Gathering ‚úç

The first step with any kind of CTF(*Capture The Flag*) challenge is to start gathering any kind of information about the machine. Clasically this means to start off by doing a **port scanning** of the host IP.

This is usually done by using the **nmap** tool, an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing.

Basically we are checking what **open ports** there are on the system, like so:


```console
$ export IP=10.10.21.22
$ mkdir nmap
$ nmap -p- -T4 -sC -sV -vvv -oA nmap/scan $IP

PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON  VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```

As we can see, we only have two ports open, **22 for SSH** and **80 for HTTP**, lets try to access the HTTP webpage( http://10.10.21.22/ in my case):



We start downloading the pictures and check for any embedded data inside of them: üì∑

```console
$ wget http://10.10.21.22/img/white_rabbit_1.jpg
$ steghide extract -sf white_rabbit_1.jpg
Enter passphrase:
wrote extracted data to "hint.txt".
$ cat hint.txt
follow the r a b b i t
```
